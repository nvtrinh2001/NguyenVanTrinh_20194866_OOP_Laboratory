Q: addDigitalVideoDisc(DigitalVideoDisc [] dvdList) and addDigitalVideoDisc(DigitalVideoDisc... dvdList)? 
A: They are both added to the list of digital video discs using an array, but the second one is more readable, so I prefer using it over the first one.

O: Is JAVA a Pass by Value or a Pass by Reference programming language?
A: In Java, arguments are passed by value. This means that when you pass a variable as an argument to a method, a copy of the value is made and passed to the method. Any changes made to the parameter within the method do not affect the original variable outside of the method.

Q: After the call of swap(jungleDVD, cinderellaDVD), why does the title of these two objects still remain?
A: Because both values are copied and pass to the swap method as arguments, therefore the original values are not changed, and the title of the two objects remains the same.

Q: After the call of changeTitle(jungleDVD, cinderellaDVD.getTitle()), why is the title of the JungleDVD changed?
A: Because in the changeTitle method, we changed the actual value of the jungleDVD object by calling the setTitle method. Therefore the title of the JungleDVD object is changed.

Q: Write a toString() method for the DigitalVideoDiscclass. What should be the return type of this method?
A: The return type of this mothod is void as the toString method does not return anything. It only prints out the string value of the DVD object.

Q: Alternatively, to compare items in the cart, instead of using Comparator, we can use the Comparable interface and override the compareTo()method. You can refer to the Java docs to see the information of this interface.  
   Suppose we are taking this Comparable interface approach. 
   What class should implement the Comparable interface? 
   In those classes, how should you implement the compareTo()method be to reflect the ordering that we want? 
   Can we have two ordering rules of the item (by title then cost and by cost then title) if we use this Comparable interface approach? 

A: If we are using the Comparable interface approach to compare items in the cart, the Media class should implement the Comparable interface.

   To implement the compareTo() method, you would need to define the logic for comparing two medias. For example, if we want to compare the cost first then the title, the method should return a negative integer if the cost of the current media is less than the other's one, or a positive integer if the current media's cost is greater than the other's one. If they are equal, we compare the title of them. The logic for the title is similar.

   It is not directly possible with the Comparable interface. The Comparable interface allows for only one natural ordering. If you need multiple ordering rules, you would need to use a Comparator instead.
